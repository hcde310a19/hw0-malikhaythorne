Part 7) In order for our program to read over the document we must first import it or send it to our program for us to access. 
Than we need our program to read over the file.
We than have establish a variable in order to keep a count of the number of words within the document. 
We need to define what a "word" is to the computer (group of symbols seperated by a space)
Than tell the computer to add 1 to our variable count every time it comes across a word
Finally we need the computer to return the final word count value to us for us to view when the program is done running. 

Part 8)  I think the previous exercise was fairly easy for me because I feel confident in logic and understanding what must go in to a program.
The most difficult part for me is expressing this to the computer because its difficult to remember what our program has built in as well as if a command exists for something you're trying to express. 
I think moving forward in the course, I want to be able to look at any problem and break it down how I did in part 7, and have the technical background to express it in code
